Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week, they are able to put their heads into their parents' pouches and feed themselves.

The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a ``tail''. Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals.

The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is ``perpetual''; the U.S. Constitution declares itself an even ``more perfect union'' than the Articles of Confederation. Other scholars, while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal, point out that sovereignty is often de facto an ``extralegal'' question.

Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.

In 1979, Seattle defeated Washington, but did not win a championship. In a championship context, if a team makes it to the NBA Finals, but does not win a championship, we can say that they have not \"ever won a championship.\" However, in this case, the question is specifically asking \"Have the Seattle Supersonics ever won a championship?\" Therefore, the question is answered \"True\" because in a championship-winning context, they did win a championship in 1979.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Yes, in general, the ocean floor is younger than the rocks on the continents. This is because the oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and eventually recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. New oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere, with the oldest oceanic lithosphere being about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Yes, a mid-ocean ridge is a divergent boundary where two tectonic plates move apart from each other, creating new crust. This results in a mountain-like structure underwater, with new seafloor being created through magma rising and solidifying on the ocean floor.\n",

Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh. Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3 °C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as oceanographers state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand).\n",

Salt water is a more general term that can refer to any water that contains high levels of dissolved salt, while sea water specifically refers to water from the ocean. In this case, \"seawater\" and \"salt water\" mean the same thing. The context provided in \"saline water,\" which is water containing a significant concentration of dissolved salts, also includes seawater and salt water. All of these terms refer to water with a high salt concentration, such as seawater's salinity of around 35,000 ppm (1.2%, 82.9 g/L).\n",

      "Passage: Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na ) and chloride (Cl ) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/L. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/L at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured −2.6 °C (27.3 °F). Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.\n",

In the 1970s David Leavitt created a true-breeding lineage as a re-creation of the healthier working bulldog from early nineteenth century England.

      "passage: Net present value (NPV) is determined by calculating the costs (negative cash flows) and benefits (positive cash flows) for each period of an investment. The period is typically one year, but could be measured in quarter-years, half-years or months. After the cash flow for each period is calculated, the present value (PV) of each one is achieved by discounting its future value (see Formula) at a periodic rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). NPV is the sum of all the discounted future cash flows. Because of its simplicity, NPV is a useful tool to determine whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. A positive NPV results in profit, while a negative NPV results in a loss. The NPV measures the excess or shortfall of cash flows, in present value terms, above the cost of funds. In a theoretical situation of unlimited capital budgeting a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a\n",

      "Helpful Answer: True\n",
      "Reasoning: Net present value (NPV) accounts for time value of money by discounting the future cash flows. By discounting the future cash flows, NPV takes into account the fact that money is worth more today than it will be in the future. The present value of each future cash flow is calculated by discounting its future value at the appropriate rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). This means that money received in the future is given a weight of less than one because it is worth less today. This is known as the time value of money and accounts for its impact on investment decisions by adjusting the present value of future cash flows for their future value.\n",

      "Question: Is it possible to be pregnant with twins by two different fathers?\n",
      "Helpful Answer: Yes, this is called heteropaternal superfecundation, which is the fertilization of two separate eggs by two different sperm during the same pregnancy. While this is rare, it has been documented in both animals and humans.\n",
      "Passage: Heteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among dizygotic twins whose parents had been involved in paternity suits.\n",
      "\n",
      "passage: Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.\n",

      "Helpful Answer: No, fraternal twins have two different sets of genes, each coming from a different parent, so it's not possible for fraternal twins to have different fathers. However, it's possible for twins to have different biological fathers through a rare occurrence called heteropaternal superfecundation. This is when sperm from one man fertilizes one egg, and sperm from a second man fertilizes the other egg during the same pregnancy.\n",

The band performs the song at a party Scotty is attending and is praised by many characters in the film (including Scotty's parents and eventually Scotty himself) as being ``catchy.'' The song becomes something of a popular phenomenon, appearing on the radio and across the world; in Bratislava, the song has been remixed and is playing in a popular nightclub.

The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well--more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).\\n\\npassage: Olympic sports are sports contested in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The 2016 Summer Olympics included 28 sports, with five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports. The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation), or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of skating, represented by the International Skating Union).

       "\"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n\\npassage: In the United States, a person must be aged 35 or over to be President or Vice President, 30 or over to be a Senator, and 25 or over to be a Representative, as specified in the U.S. Constitution. Most states in the U.S. also have age requirements for the offices of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative. Some states have a minimum age requirement to hold any elected office (usually 21 or 18).\\nanswer: True\\ntitle: Age of candidacy\\nquestion: Is there an age limit to run for us president?\\n\\nQuestion: Is there an age limit to compete in the olympics?\\nHelpful Answer: According to the passage, gymnastic age requirements have had controversies in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to age restrictions and raising the requirements from 14 to 15 in 1981 and then to 16in 1997. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a minimum age to compete in the olympics in gymnastics.\\nZephyr: False\\nLlama2_content: None\\nLlama2: None\\n\\npassage: The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country for which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.\\nanswer: True\\ntitle: Olympic Games\\nquestion: Do you have to have citizenship to compete in the olympics?\\n\\npassage: Olympic regulations regarding amateur status of athletes were eventually abandoned in the 1990s with the exception of wrestling, where the amateur fight rules are used due to the fact that professional wrestling is largely staged with pre-determined outcomes. Starting from the 2016 Summer Olympics, professionals were allowed to compete in boxing, though amateur fight rules are still used for the tournament.\\nanswer: True\\ntitle: Amateur sports\\nquestion: Can professional athletes play in the winter olympics?\\n\\npassage: Olympic regulations regarding amateur status of athletes were eventually abandoned in the 1990s with the exception of wrestling, where the amateur fight rules are used due to the fact that professional wrestling is largely staged with pre-determined outcomes.
